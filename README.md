# **Project Overview**

This project focuses on forecasting stock prices using time series modeling and machine learning techniques. The primary goals include:

* Acquiring historical stock data
  
* Preprocessing for accurate modeling

* Comparing models such as ARIMA, Random Forest, LSTM for short and long-term predictions

* Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE and MAE

 ## **Methodology & Approach**

 ### **Data Acquisition**

* Fetches stock market data from trusted sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance) via APIs such as yfinance

* Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

* Handled missing values, outliers, and transformed time series data into supervised learning format

### **Modelling Approach**

* Implemented statistical models (e.g., ARIMA/SARIMA)

* Built machine learning approaches like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting

* Applied deep learning models—LSTM or hybrid architectures—for advanced forecasting

### **Evaluation**

* Calculated error metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE

* Visualized model predictions vs. actuals for qualitative assessment

### **Visualization**

* Plotted historical trends and forecasted values

## Results 

Forecasted stock prices for the next 60 days using an optimized ARIMA(2,0,0) model, achieving an RMSE of 39.1.
